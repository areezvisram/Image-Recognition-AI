# Image-Recognition-AI
## An Image Recognition AI created for an Artificial Intelligence class at McMaster University
* This AI was created to show an example of an AI that was proposed in my report written for Innovate 1Z03 at McMaster University
* The report outlines our plans and research into a proposed AI whose purpose would be to be able to identify cancer cells based on image recognition and federated learning techniques.
* This AI shows the process that would be used for cancer cell image recognition. This AI is trained on the dataset included in the repository and is able to identify everyday common objects using image recognition
* The detailed report of the proposed cancer cell detecting AI can also be found in the repository
